# CS-351-Projects

# Michael Smith

These are the 3 projects that I completed for CS-351 Design of Large Programs.  Each had its own unique problems and I will likely be 
going back and trying to refactor them at a later date.  Below I will give a brief description of each project.

SiteRiter

This is a parser that reads in Site Design Language(SDL) and uses that to auto generate websites.  The input needs to be valid SDL with valid HTML within its data.

FrobWorld

FrobWorld is a simple genetic algorithm that simulates the life cycles of Frobs.  The Frobs eat grass and get bigger, when big enough they split into 2 Frobs.  There are also rocks in the environment that cause Frobs to lose mass if hit.  The evolution occurs in which directions they choose to move and how much they move.

TileNet

This is a client/server game that what was made using a class standard.  The objective was to get every groups client to work with other groups servers and vice versa.  This turns out to be extremely hard and for the most part each teams code only worked perfectly with their own code.  The actual server was required to have 2 tile based games that you could choose from and play.
As a group project this was very difficult and I got to learn one of the most important lessons I think I will ever learn in software engineering... don't over design.  There are several abstract factories that should not be there but lesson learned.
